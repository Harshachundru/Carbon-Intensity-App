# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Script files details

The source folder contains on App.js, App.css. Index.js etc.

The App.js was the simple functional component for the carbon intensity app.

The react hooks such as useEffect, useState are used to update and change the state of the json objects which are fetched by async call of an arrow function getCarbonData.

The "getCarbonData" was the function which the controlls the api calls and update the state of "carbonIntensity" array.

While the user input was required to display the carbon intesitydata on specified date.

For fetching user data, the buttons are used and are controlled by "handleClickEvent".

The "handleClickEvent" get the particular "id" of the button which was clicked and assigns the "id-value" to "selected" data-type by "setSelected" method in the react-useState.

The objects are looped to the table roows and colomns by conditional redering and map method.

The object.keys are used to deal with objects in the API's Json data. 

The styles are imported from bootstrap and Navbar was created.

The buttons for user interactivity are placed in a container and jumbotron.Similarly, the output readings are also displayed in bootstrap-container.
